# sTunes Exploratory Data Analysis Project
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQLite to explore and analyze data from a fictional music streaming app, similar to iTunes. The dataset catalogs various consumer data related to music records, songs, and playlists, providing insights into user preferences and behaviors. As part of my learning journey, this analysis explores how consumer interactions with the music catalog can reveal trends in song popularity, playlist composition, and user engagement. By examining these patterns, the project aims to uncover key insights into consumer behavior that can inform business decisions such as content recommendations, marketing strategies, and user experience improvements. Ultimately, this exploration helps to understand how data-driven insights into consumer preferences can shape product offerings and enhance overall business strategy.
